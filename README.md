## üëÄ Why did I want to create Bytes?

- Staying informed about current affairs is important to many people, including me, as it allows one to keep up with the latest developments in the world around them. However, with so much information available from a variety of sources, it can be overwhelming to try to read and digest all of it. Many people may not have the time or inclination to read through lengthy articles regularly, yet still want to stay informed.

- This is when I thought building a good app that provides summarized article content can be incredibly valuable. By providing concise and easily digestible summaries of news articles, such an app can enable people to stay informed about current affairs without having to spend hours reading through multiple articles. This can help people to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the world, even when they are short on time.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

- Bytes offers users access to real-time news updates from four different countries, namely India, the USA, Australia, and the UK. With updates being provided every 20 minutes, users can rest assured that they are receiving the most up-to-date and relevant news from these regions.

- Bytes leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence to provide users with a summarized version of each news article. This feature allows users to quickly and easily get an overview of the key points and main ideas presented in the article. By utilizing state-of-the-art NLP-based MindsDB models, Bytes is able to generate highly accurate and relevant summaries that capture the essence of each article. This feature not only saves time for users but also provides them with the necessary information to make informed decisions about the news they are consuming.

- Bytes also offers sentiment and emotion prediction for each news article, allowing users to quickly assess the tone and overall theme of the article. This feature provides an additional layer of information that can aid in understanding the news and its potential impact.
